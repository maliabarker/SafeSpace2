# SafeSpace2
SafeSpace page, but with bootstrap

SafeSpace is an online, anonymous social media platform for college students. SafeSpace is aimed to be a platform for users to talk freely about mental health and everyday stressors in life.
This page is built with bootstrap V4 so far. 
It will further include a backend created with Flask and PyMongo, coming soon!
Feel free to check out the UI, available on github pages at https://maliabarker.github.io/SafeSpace2/
